TASK 03: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Bank Marketing Dataset SkillCraft Technology
**Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset**
As part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology, I worked on predicting client subscription to term deposits using a Decision Tree Classifier.

ðŸ”¹ **Dataset:** Portuguese bank marketing data (\~4,500 entries)
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y)
ðŸ”¹ **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, graphviz

**âœ… Key Steps:**

* Preprocessed the dataset
* Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
* Evaluated using Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
* Exported predictions (CSV) and tree visualization (PNG)
